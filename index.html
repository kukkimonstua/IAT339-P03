    <p>From the first video game I played to the first animation I made, I became entranced with the world of entertainment as a career. I asked myself, what is it about new media arts that makes me feel this way? I realized the magic comes from within storytelling and interaction. The idea of being able to immerse someone inside an entire world that I created made me fall in love with cinematography, storytelling, and game developing. As a student of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University, my passion in making entertainment is the ability to tap into my audience's emotions.</p>
